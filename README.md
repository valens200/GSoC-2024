<!--**About me** -->



<!--Hello, I'm **Valens NIYONSENGA**, a graduate in Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, and Embedded Systems from Rwanda Coding Academy. Over the past three years, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to dive deep into building and designing full-stack applications. Being part of the FOSSology community through Google Summer of Code 2024 is something I‚Äôm really excited about.-->

<!--This article is a detailed report of my contributions, documenting the progress I‚Äôve made during my 12 weeks of coding with FOSSology as part of GSoC 2024.-->

<h1 align = "center" id = "project-details">üìù Project Details</h1>


## Overview

<p align="justify">
This project aims to address the need for improving and upgrading APIs on FOSSology to version 2 by identifying areas for enhancement, fixing issues, and ensuring that clients using V1 aren't affected. To solve this, There are three main objectives to focus on. First, enhancing existing APIs by adding missing features for comprehensive implementation. Second, upgrading REST APIs to version 2, fixing bugs, and adopting new design patterns for efficient functionality. Additionally, any new endpoints added will adhere to Version 2 standards. My plan includes quality assurance measures, such as unit and integration testing, to ensure all requirements are met satisfactorily. Overall, my goal is to improve the usability and effectiveness of FOSSology's APIs for a better user experience.

During my participation in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, I focused on enhancing the quality of the system by improving and adding new unit and integration test cases.Through this, I tested all functionalities to verify whether they work as expected and meet the requirements. After finishing unit test cases development for APIs and models, I tackeled integration tests for Data Access Objects (DAOs).

1.  #### Unit tests development
 
- I developed new unit test cases for all controllers and models contributing to the quality improvement of the software, verifying that API units and models are working as expected.
2.  #### Api test cases upgrade to version 2
- Since my collegue [Divij](https://github.com/dvjsharma) was upgrading REST APIs to version 2, the same to my side, I dedicate my time to upgrade all test cases to version 2.

3.  #### Integration tests development
- Finally, After improving and enhancing some integration tests that were available in Data Access Objects (DAOs), I developed new integration test cases verifying that all DAOs components and database are properly working together to meet the requirements as expected.

- #### Implement end-to-end tests for FOSSology APIs:
   To ensure high quality software, there is still a work to do. I look forward to finalizing additional end-to-end tests development for FOSSology APIs to verify that all functionalities are working as expected and meeting the requirements.
In the pipeline are several exciting improvements to look forward to:

- #### Guiding new contributors to FOSSology:
   I look forward to providing a full guidance new contributors for not only contributing to FOSSology Excellence in license compliance but also broadening the open-source family.
- #### Provide more contributions:
   As I started the open-source journey, I won't step back.I will keep my dedication , determination and love to open-source. I will keep contributing to FOSSology, guiding and mentoring new contributors as well.
