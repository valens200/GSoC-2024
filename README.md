## Google Summer of Code 2024 üö© Report: "REST API Improvements" 

 
About me 

  

Hello, I'm **Valens NIYONSENGA**, a proud Software Engineering and Embedded Systems graduate at [**Rwanda Coding Academy**](http://rca.ac.rw/). With over 4 years of hands-on experience in building full stack applications, I'm thrilled to be an active member of the FOSSology community for Google Summer of Code 2024.

  

In this article am going to outline the details of my contributions as a reference of project completion during the 12 weeks of coding.

  

# üåè CONTRIBUTIONS Overview

  

During my participation in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, I focused on enhancing the quality of education by improving and adding new unit test cases for unit and integration tests. I managed to test both APIs and models.

1.  #### Unit tests development:



3.  #### Integration tests development



4.  #### Api test cases upgrade to version 2

5.  #### End-to-end tests development

  
  

## Unit test cases development:

  ### APIs test cases.


#### Models test cases.
## Integration test cases development.

## Documentation:üìÑ

Throughout the 12 weeks of the GSoC period, I created weekly documentation for recording and tracking my progress. The documentation can be found [**here**](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2024/rest/updates/valens/2024-05-30)

| Enhanced and added new unit tests for models| Yes        | :heavy_check_mark:  |  |
| Improved and added new integration tests for Data Access Objects| Yes | :heavy_check_mark: | There's still a work ahead to ensure that all the DAOs follow integration testing standards and also making sure that the test coverage for each is at least 75%. |
| Adding end-to-end tests for APIs | NO (WAS OPTIONAL) | :x: | This is an ongoing work current and even additional APIs that will be added in the future.

## Thoughts

As we move forward in the real world, there's always room for improvement in every line of code. I want to extend my sincere thanks to my mentor, the organization admins, and the community members for their continuous support and assistance throughout this project. It has been an exciting journey working with this wonderful community, and I‚Äôve gained so much from the experience. I would also like to thank Google for providing this incredible opportunity. Keep pushing code!
